# Submission Readiness Report (2026-05-20)

## Verdict

Project codebase is **ready for submission** from the engineering side.

All required local validations passed today, and all requested components (including extendability, weather integration, time-series sync, Grafana dashboard assets, and Great Expectations + Telegram trigger) are present.

## What Was Verified Today

### 1) Automated checks

- Unit tests: `Ran 9 tests` -> `OK`
- Pipeline run: `requested=4 succeeded=4 failed=0 skipped=0`
- Quality checks: `PASSED` (`tables=5`, `expectations=19`, `failures=0`)
- Weather sync dry run: success (`No new weather rows to sync`)
- Weather sync one-off run: success (`No new weather rows to sync`)

### 2) Deliverables present in repository

- Medallion pipeline framework and dataset extensions:
  - `fabric_project/pipelines/runner.py`
  - `fabric_project/pipelines/extensions/*.py`
- Weather external integration:
  - `fabric_project/integrations/weather_sync_job.py`
  - `config/weather_sync.yaml`
- Data quality + user trigger:
  - `fabric_project/quality/runner.py`
  - `fabric_project/integrations/telegram_bot.py`
  - `config/quality_checks.yaml`
- Grafana dashboard + datasource provisioning:
  - `dashboards/grafana/dashboards/weather-overview.json`
  - `dashboards/grafana/provisioning/datasources/influxdb.yaml`
- Warehouse star schema:
  - `sql/fabric_warehouse_star_schema.sql`
- Documentation set:
  - `docs/architecture.md`
  - `docs/data_dictionary.md`
  - `docs/lineage.md`
  - `docs/governance_policies.md`
  - `docs/extensibility.md`
  - `docs/fabric_setup.md`

### 3) Data artifacts present

Gold outputs exist for all project datasets:

- `data/lakehouse/gold/nyc_taxi/fact_taxi_daily.parquet`
- `data/lakehouse/gold/openaq/fact_air_quality_daily.parquet`
- `data/lakehouse/gold/economy/fact_fx_gdp_daily.parquet`
- `data/lakehouse/gold/weather/fact_weather_hourly.parquet`
- `data/lakehouse/gold/weather/fact_weather_daily.parquet`

## Final Manual Items Before Demo/Submission

These are environment/platform steps (not code defects):

1. Start Docker runtime (Colima/Docker Desktop) before live Grafana+InfluxDB demo.
2. In `.env`, set `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_CHAT_IDS` to your Telegram chat id(s) for production-safe bot access.
3. In Fabric portal, verify final cloud wiring:
   - Lakehouse folders/tables visible in Bronze/Silver/Gold
   - Dataflow Gen2 entities saved (no empty QueriesMetadata)
   - Pipeline schedule active
   - Notebook and Warehouse execution green
4. Apply Microsoft Purview sensitivity labels in Fabric and capture evidence:
   - Label report, dashboard, semantic model, and dataflow.
   - Confirm `Sensitivity` column is visible in list view.
   - Save screenshots for submission packet.
5. If Git integration is required directly from Fabric workspace:
   - Ask tenant admin to enable GitHub provider in tenant settings.
   - Complete workspace `Git integration` after provider is enabled.

## Notes

- API network failures were handled gracefully during validation by cached fallback logic (OpenAQ/World Bank/ECB/Open-Meteo), which is expected behavior for resilient execution.
- No Discord integration references remain; Telegram-only path is active.
